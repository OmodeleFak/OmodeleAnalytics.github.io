									<p>With my experience in several projects spanning the entire data ecosystem, I have displayed here a few samples of work using synthetically generated datasets
										and open source datasets. These projects include scripting of stored procedure with T-SQL, data exploration with Python, dashboards, visualizations, and data reporting
										visualizations with Power BI, Tableau and SSRS. <br />

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/Pharmacy_Store/blob/main/PharmacyStoreProject.sql">T-SQL: Dynamically Populating Multiple Transaction Tables in a Database<br />
										</a></h2>
										<p>The purpose of this project was to dynamically populate the transaction tables of pharmacy store with several branches across Canada. Data sets used were synthetically generated to mimic real world scenarios where one or pharmacy assistants are attached to pharmacists. 
											Logical and physical tables of relational database were created in appropriate cardinality and granularity with snowflakes schema. T-SQL scripts in Stored Procedures, which is efficient in querying cost, were written to automatically populate the transaction tables.<br />

										</a></h2>
										<p>This is a Power BI reporting solution developed to answer some business questions for a Poulry Farm with focus on egg production. The data used in this project were synthetically generated and business   
											questions likened to real world. Insights on business performnace per cage of the years were provided. Some of the intelligence provided include: analysis of egg collection; cost of feeding the layers; mortality rate of layers; and of course, quanity of sales and eventual profits. 
											Employed here were page navigation, bookmarking and other advanced Power BI functions.<br />

												with Python<br />
										</a></h2>
										<p>The exercise here involved the exploration and cleaning of the SQF 2012 data sets with Python. With over 100 columns, the tasks here were conducted with select 
											attributes. The process involved the use of Python libraries such as Folium, tqdm, openpyxl, pyproject, seaborn and many more. Some of the cleaning done 
											include conversion of height to centimeter from feet, excluding unrealistic ages such as toddlers, removing some outliers and coercing a few others.
											And some of the explorations done include distribution check for age, weight, height and gender. Type of force applied, police identification and lot 
											more were explored. The data sets can be assessed by clicking on the image. <br />

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/Titanic_Classifications/blob/main/classification.py">Machine Learning: Predicting Titanic Survival with Various Classification Models<br />
										</a></h2>
										<p>This project was aimed at predicting the likelihood survival in infamous Titanic event, which records the tragic events of April 15, 1912, when the ship sank, resulting in the loss
											of 1502 lives out of 2224 passengers and crew members. 5 classification models were employed with "Survived" as the label based on the key attributes including "Pclass", "Age", 
											"SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Sex" and "Embarked".<br />							
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/OmodeleFak/Titanic_Classifications/blob/main/classification.py" class="image fit"><img src="images/titanic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> While the accuracies were same for Random Forest (0.80), Support Vector Mechanism (0.80) and KNN (0.80), it was a little different with Logistic Regression (0.75) and Gradient Boosting (0.79). 
										Within the context of survival prediction, precision and f1-scores are of greater importance to minimize false positives. Hence, Support Vector Mechanism with precision
										and f1-score of 83% and 74% respectively was found to the most suitable.
